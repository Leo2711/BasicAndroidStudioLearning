# BasicAndroidStudioLearning
In this repository I have Android Studio projects that I made on my learning path.

### SimpleInterfaceWith DB
This project was the first "complicated" that I worked on. It is not finished because it doesn't have accounts and stored data of them. It was only for practice with ActionBars, Drawer Menu, RecycleView, and creation and connection to a SQLite DB.
